# SVM-Constrained Bayesian Optimization 
This repository implements the Support Vector Machine Constrained Bayesian Optimization (SVM-CBO) proposed in [1] and already used for a real-life application like Pump Scheduling Optimization in Water Distribution System in [2] and HPO task on Convolutional Neural Networks in [3-4] for Tiny Machine Learning.

# SVMCBO
Python implementation of Support Vector Machine - Constrained Bayesian Optimization (SVM-CBO)

## Packages Requirements
Execute the following command to retrieve all libraries dependecies for the software:


## Instructions to use the constrained optimization framework
To use this optimization framework you have to define the following parts:
1) In "testFunctions.R" define the objective function and insert the name of the function defined to variable "f_test" in "main_SVM-CBO.R" file
2) Insert the number of dimension of the objective function to variable "dim_f" in "main_SVM_CBO.R" file
3) Insert the values of minimum and maximum dimensions of the objective function in "real_x_min" and "real_x_max" in "main_SVM_CBO.R" file. In case the objective function has different domains values for its dimensions initialise the above variables with vectors of minimum and maximum values.
4) Decide with boolean variable "opt_min" the orientation of optimization task in "main_SVM_CBO.R" file 
5) Decide the number of optimization experiment to run with SVM-CBO with variable "nExperiments" in "main_SVM_CBO.R"
6) Execute the experiments running the "main_SVM_CBO.R" file

At the end of "main_SVM_CBO.R" execution all the experiments results are save in "SVM-CBO_results_experiments.RData" file.
