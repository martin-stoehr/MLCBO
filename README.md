# Support Vector Machine - Constrained Bayesian Optimization 
This repository implements the Python version of Support Vector Machine - Constrained Bayesian Optimization (SVM-CBO) proposed in [1] and already used for a real-life applications like Pump Scheduling Optimization in Water Distribution System in [2] and HPO task on Convolutional Neural Networks in [3-4]\* for Tiny Machine Learning.

## Packages Requirements
The Python version currently supported is 3.7.  
The requirements to use this library are contained inside of "requirements_SVMCBO.txt".  
Can be used pip command to install all requirements.

## Instructions to use the constrained optimization framework
A script named "ExampleOnTestFunction.py reports an example of how to use SVMCBO framework on two simple test functions.
